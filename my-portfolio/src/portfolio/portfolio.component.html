          <h2>Personal Website - HTML</h2>
          <p>This project is a personal website that was built during a bootcamp with codeTribe. It showcases a clean, responsive design, meaning it adapts well to different screen sizes—whether on a phone, tablet, or desktop. This website was crafted to introduce and represent the creator, featuring sections about skills, work experience, and achievements. Imagine a digital business card, but much more detailed. It’s an online space where visitors can get a feel for the creator’s work and background in a visually appealing, accessible way.</p>

          <h2>Memory Game</h2>
          <p>Inspired by classic memory games, this project is an interactive and engaging experience where players match pairs of cards. Created with the support of codeTribe, it uses visuals and smooth animations to make gameplay fun and easy to understand. Think of a digital card game that sharpens memory skills, suitable for kids and adults alike. The game flips cards to reveal pictures of the alphabet, challenging the player to find matching pairs.</p>

          <h2>Portfolio Website - Angular</h2>
          <p>This is an advanced version of the personal website, built as a professional portfolio using Angular, a popular framework for web development. It includes various sections to highlight the creator’s projects, skills, and work history in a modern, polished format, aimed at demonstrating both creativity and technical skill. This portfolio is like a digital resume, but more interactive. Instead of just text, it uses animations, links, and media to provide an engaging way to showcase work and connect with potential collaborators or employers.</p>
